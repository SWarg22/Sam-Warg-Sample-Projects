# Sam-Warg-Sample-Projects

Attached to this repository are various projects I have worked on! 
- "PracProjFinalReport.Rmd" is a R Markdown file of a project recently completed in my Capstone course at The Ohio State University using the nycflights13 dataset provided in R. This was a group assignment; however, it is a good representation of the work I am capable of completing, as I had a large role in the coding and statistical analysis that was required to complete it.
- "PracProjFinalReport.html is the knitted file from the .Rmd file above.
- "Diabetes Analysis" is a project I completed by myself for a Data Mining course, where the objective was to create a model that predicts whether or not a patient has diabetes or not based on a variety of predictors. This was completed in Python on a Jupyter Notebook.
- "diabetes_hw_data_3494.csv" is the data that was used to run the Diabetes Analysis Jupyter Notebook code.
- "MLB_Plots.R" is an R file that I worked on in my free time over the summer, where I wanted to create meaningful visuals of different statistics for all 30 MLB teams at that point in the 2022 season (August 8 - August 10). 

If there are any questions about these projects I have completed, please email me at samueljwarg@gmail.com.

Thank you!
